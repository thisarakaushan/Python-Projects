    "Build a Number Guessing Game using the Tkinter library in Python. The game will prompt the player to guess a random number within a specified range. After each guess, the game will provide feedback to the player, indicating whether the guess is too high or too low. The player's objective is to guess the correct number within the fewest attempts."
